				<h3 class="font-weight-bold ">WILL WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL DATA WITH THIRD PARTIES?</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-700">
					Information about our users is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling
					our users’ personal information to others. We may transfer personal data to our service providers or third
					parties in connection with
					block
					assets's operation of its business, as certain features on Block-Assets rely on various third-party products
					and services (collectively “Third Party Services”), . These third party services providers only have access
					to certain Personal
					Information, such as your public Wallet addresses, to perform their functions and may not use it for other
					purposes. Furthermore, they must process the personal information in accordance with our contractual
					agreements and only as permitted by
					applicable data protections laws.
					Business transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or
					services. In such transactions, user information generally is one of the transferred business assets but
					remains subject to the promises made
					in
					any pre-existing Privacy notice (unless, of course, the user consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely
					event that block-assets or substantially all of its assets are acquired, users' information will be one of
					the transferred assets.
					We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners- like publishers,
					advertisers, developers, or right holders.
				</p>
				<h3 class="font-weight-bold ">HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE GATHER</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-700">
					We primarily use the limited information that we collect to enhance Block-Assets. Except if we sell all or a
					portion of our business, or as otherwise described below, we do not rent, trade, or sell your Personal
					Information.
					Some ways we may use your Personal Information are to:
					Contact you when necessary;
					Respond to your comments, questions, or issues related to bugs or errors with Block-Assets;
					Provide you with additional information;
					Send you information and marketing materials about services and products available through Block-Assets,
					using push notifications or other means;
					Train our team members;
					Other internal business purposes.
					Aggregated Personal Data and Non-Personal Information
					We may share or disclose aggregated Personal Data or Non-Personal Information with service providers or with
					other persons we conduct business with, including but not limited potential third-parties for the purpose of
					showcasing the performance
					of the company. These service providers and other persons may also share with us aggregated Non-Personal
					Information that they have independently developed or acquired. Additionally, we may combine aggregate
					information from the pixel tags, and
					web beacons, with similar data we collect from other visitors to help us improve our Services. When doing
					so, we do our best to ensure that aggregated information cannot be linked back to you.
					Agents or Third Party Partners
					We may provide your Personal Information to our employees, contractors, agents, service providers, and
					designees (“Agents”) to enable them to perform certain services for us, including improvement of
					website-related services and features, and
					performance of maintenance services.
					Business Transfers
					We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one
					of the business assets that would be transferred. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out
					of business, enter
					bankruptcy,
					or go through some other change of control, your Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred
					to or acquired by a third party. By accepting this Privacy Notice, as outlined above, you consent to any
					such transfer.
					Protection of Us and Others
					We will share personal information outside of Block-Assets if we have a reasonable belief that access, use,
					preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law,
					regulation, legal process, or
					enforceable governmental request; to cooperate with law enforcement; to enforce or apply our Terms of Use
					and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Block-Assets, our employees, our
					users, or others.
				</p>
				<h3 class="font-weight-bold ">YOUR RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-700">
					You are entitled (under the conditions, and subject to the exceptions, set out in applicable law) to:
					Request Access to the personal information we process about you: You can request access to the information
					we have collected from you. You can do this by contacting us at support@Block-Assets.com. We will provide you
					with a copy of the data we
					process about you. To comply with your request, we may ask you to verify your identity. We will fulfill your
					request by sending your copy electronically. For any subsequent access request, we may charge you an
					administrative fee.
					Request a rectification of your personal data: If you believe that the information we have collected is
					incorrect or incomplete, you may contact us so we can update it and keep your data accurate.
					Object to the processing of your personal data: you may request that we no longer process your personal
					data.
					Request to erase your personal data: you may request the erasure of your personal data, including where such
					personal data would no longer be necessary to achieve the purposes for which it was collected. Any data that
					is no longer needed for
					purposes specified in the “How We Use the Information We Gather” section will be deleted after ninety (90)
					days. Wallet addresses created through the Block-Assets application cannot be deleted from the Ethereum
					blockblock, therefore we are
					unable
					to delete this personal information. If at any point you wish for Block-Assets to delete information about
					you, you may contact us at support@Block-Assets.com.
					Request the restriction of the processing of your personal data: you may request that block-assets only
					processes your personal data in limited circumstances, including with your consent.
					Under California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”) you also have the right not to be discriminated against
					because of the exercise of your rights. Please note that we do not sell your personal data.
				</p>
				<h3 class="font-weight-bold ">DATA RETENTION</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-700">
					Please note that even If you delete your Wallet or addresses from the Block-Assets mobile application,
					uninstall Block-Assets mobile applications from your device, or request that your information be deleted, we
					still may retain some
					information
					that you have provided to us to maintain Block-Assets or to comply with the laws and regulations to which
					Block-Assets is subject.
					If you have any question or objection as to how we collect and process your personal information, please
					contact support@Block-Assets.com.</p>
				<h3 class="font-weight-bold ">DATA SECURITY</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-700">
					We are committed to making sure your information is protected in accordance with applicable laws and our
					data privacy policies. We have selected third-party vendors that use the Ethereum network, including
					Coinbase, Shapeshift, and Changelly,
					that help us keep your Personal Information safe. Unfortunately, we do not control these third parties and
					therefore cannot guarantee complete security. We work to protect the security of your personal information
					during transmission by using
					encryption protocols and software. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection
					with the collection, storage and disclosure of your personal information and secure all connections with
					industry standard transport
					layer
					security. Even with all these precautions, we cannot fully guarantee against the access, disclosure,
					alteration, or deletion of data through events, including but not limited to hardware or software failure or
					unauthorized use. Any information
					that you provide to us is done so entirely at your own risk.</p>
				<h3 class="font-weight-bold "> CHILDREN</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-700">
					We are especially sensitive about children’s information. Our Services are not targeted towards children,
					and our users must be at least eighteen (18) years old to use our services. We don’t knowingly collect
					information from children under the
					age of 13. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a minor child, we will treat any information that you
					provide us while using Block-Assets on behalf of your minor child as Personal Information as otherwise
					provided in this Privacy Policy. If
					you have questions concerning our information practices with respect to children, or if you learn that a
					child under the age of 13 has used Block-Assets, created a user account, or provided us with personal
					information, please email us at
					support@Block-Assets.com
				</p>
				<h3 class="font-weight-bold ">CONDITIONS OF USE, NOTICES, CHANGES AND UPDATES TO PRIVACY NOTICE</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-700">
					If you choose to use block-assets, your use and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our
					Terms of Use. If you have any concerns about privacy at Block-Assets, please contact us with a complete
					description, and we will try to
					resolve it. You also have the right to contact your local Data Protection Authority.
					We reserve the right to update and revise this Privacy Nolicy at any time. We occasionally review this
					Privacy Notice to make sure it complies with applicable laws and conforms to changes in our business. If we
					do revise this Privacy Notice, we
					will update the “Effective Date” at the top of this page so that you can tell if it has changed since your
					last visit and will do our best to notify you. Please review this Privacy Notice regularly to ensure that
					you are aware of its terms. Any
					use of Block-Assets after an amendment to our Privacy Notice constitutes your acceptance to the revised or
					amended terms.
				</p>
				<h3 class="font-weight-bold "> QUESTIONS</h3>
